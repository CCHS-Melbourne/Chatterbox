#Chatterbox 

##Aim:

A probably outdated-by-now project to create OpenAI assistants with access to manuals for equipment like 3d-printers in order to make it easier and funner for new users to learn to use said equipment. Bonus addition of voice effects to differentiate the voices a bit from stock open-AI voices. 

In many ways, this project is like a home assistant speaker box. It is like a hobbyist hat for a raspberry pi. While an internet/phone application would likely be the best implimentation of such a concept from a cost perspective, I started doing this and had a bit of fun learning along the way. 

This is similar to the chatbot designed by [pdp12](https://www.instructables.com/Customizes-a-ChatGPT-Assistant-Using-a-RaspberryPi/)

##To use:
An OpenAI account and subsquent API key is required.
Save your API details into the .env file

##Code:
The code sets up 

##To do: 
The ability to close old threads and start new threads would be nice
The addition of status LEDs would be great, which I think has to be handled by a smaller microcontroller like an ATtiny.
